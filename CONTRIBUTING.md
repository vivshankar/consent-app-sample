## Generating documentation

To generate the HTML docs for an SDK component, run `jsdoc` in the directory containing the projects file of the component. Then view the docs in the `verify-sdk-docs/javascript/<component>/docs` directory:

```
open index.html
```

### License header in source files

Each source file must include a license header for the Apache
Software License 2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach.
e.g.

```
/*
Copyright IBM Corp. All Rights Reserved.

SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
*/
```

### Sign your work

In accordance to the approach used by the Linux® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) and described in the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt), we request that each contributor signs off their change by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to each commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```
